# Fall 2019 Foundations of Web Design and Development ‚Äî Assignment 3 (Basic CSS)

* **Do not edit this file.**

## Introduction

This assignment extends on your second assignment by applying basic principles of design using CSS.

## Before You Begin
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Fork this repo(sitory). See [this video](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/forking-and-cloning-at-the-github-web-site/) on how to carry out this step and step `3`. **Ensure you‚Äôre forking the repository from me and not another student in the course.**
3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## The Rules
If you received anything less than a 90 on the second assignment, you will first need to address those issues before proceeding. This means that items for which you lost points need to be corrected before starting this assignment. Look at the **Directions** and **The Rules** sections of the second assignment and note the comments you received in the assignment grade report email you received during the week of 6 Oct‚Äì12 Oct.

* Create a style sheet called `style.css` and place it in the included `css` folder. All your CSS must go in this file. No embedded or inline CSS is allowed.
* Style the site-wide navigation of your assignment as a row of links, not a column.
* Employ two colors ‚Äî neither of which can be a neutral ‚Äî for backgrounds, text, or accents, such as borders, bullets, etc.
* Reassign the default image you used in assignment 2 from `index.html` to `about.html`.
* Add a Creative Commons-licensed image as a hero to the `index.html` page.
* Any images you use must be placed in the enclosed `img` folder.
* Each image you use cannot be larger than 1MB.
* Employ two different typefaces from Google Fonts into your assignment: one for headings and one for reading text.
* Your HTML must be valid, per the [w3c-validation](https://atom.io/packages/w3c-validation) Atom package. You may also validate at [http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
* Your CSS must also be valid, per the [w3c-validation](https://atom.io/packages/w3c-validation) and the [linter-stylelint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-stylelint) Atom packages.
* Folders and files must use lowercase, combined with kebab case. For example, `do-this` or `do-this.html`. Further, no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); and, no snake case (`not_this`).
